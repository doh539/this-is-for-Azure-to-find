# this-is-for-Azure-to-find
Test to see if i can get the repo into Azure

Lets see if i can find this in Azure - i will commit this to a new branch and check - if CI does not work i will merge this and then try to push to Azure (if Push is thd right word for it.

lets see what pasting the Azure code line into this does

git remote add origin https://doh539@dev.azure.com/doh539/Github%20to%20Azure/_git/Github%20to%20Azure
git push -u origin --all
